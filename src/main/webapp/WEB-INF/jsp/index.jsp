    <h1>Jack Alexander</h1>
    <br>
    I am a junior software engineer at Google in Sunnyvale, CA.
    I have been working on
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load">ETL</a>
    systems for the Spanner and F1 databaes since 2018. Our team
    develops primarily in C++.
    <br>
    <br>
    I graduated from the University of California, Santa Barbara in
    2018 with a bachelor's and a master's in computer science. I
    am always happy to talk to UCSB students, alumni, and faculty.
    <br>
    <br>
    I am not currently looking for a new position, but if you want
    to contact me about collaborating on a project (or have an
    opportunity you absolutely must share), please message me on
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-alexander-72841b9a/">LinkedIn</a>,
    or email
    <a href="mailto:jalexander.qed@gmail.com">jalexander.qed@gmail.com</a>.
    <br>
    <br>
    You can look through my
    <a href="https://github.com/jalexanderqed">GitHub</a>
    for samples of my work, including
    <a href="https://github.com/jalexanderqed/gcloud-website">the source</a>
    for this website. Bear in mind that very little of the code is recent,
    and none is professional-grade.
